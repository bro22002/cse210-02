# HiLo
The game of HiLo is straightforward, simply guess if the next card will be higher or lower than the current cards.
If you guess correctly, you will earn 100 points, but if you are wrong, you will loose 75 points!
If your score ever drops to 0 or lower, the game will end and you loose!
At any time, type "quit" to end the game, and win the game with a high score.
